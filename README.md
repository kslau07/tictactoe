    ⬛ Gameboard will be an array
    ⬛ Players will be stored in objects
    ⬛ One object will control the flow of the game
    ⬛ Minimize globally scoped code
        ⬛ Utilize factory functions to hide code
        ⬛ Single instances should be wrapped in an IIFE
    ⬛ Each piece of functionality should reside in:
        * Game, Player or Gameboard object
    ⬛ For help on how to structure our code:

    ⬛ First create a game that works in the console
    ⬛ Then write an object that will handle display/DOM logic
        ⬛ Write a function to render the gameboard
        ⬛ Write a function to allow a player to place their mark
            ⬛ A player may not go on an occupied space
    ⬛ Finishing touches:
        ⬛ A player may write their name
        ⬛ A button to begin and to start a new round
        ⬛ A display that declares the winner
        ⬛ A tally of wins for each player

        ⬛ Rotate the board slightly, 1-3°, maybe lines too
